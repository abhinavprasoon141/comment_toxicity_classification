# Comment Toxicity Classification
## 1. Problem Statement
We are provided with a large number of Wikipedia comments which have been labeled by human raters for toxic behavior. The types of toxicity are:

* toxic
* severe_toxic
* obscene
* threat
* insult
* identity_hate


We must create a model which predicts a probability of each type of toxicity for each comment.
